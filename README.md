PATTRMM (Plex Assistant To The Regional Meta Manager) is a python script that automates a 'Returning Soon' Trakt list in chronological order by date and matching metadata and overlay file for use in [Plex Meta Manager](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/index.html). Extensions have been added to further PATTRMM's capabilities.

> **_NOTE:_** The latest update changes the *-returning-soon.yml to *-returning-soon-metadata.yml. Make sure to update your pmm config file with the new filename if you've updated your script. If you want to use the new alignment options then you will also need to delete your old 'pattrmm/preferences/' template files.


## Installation


### Requirements

Obviously, Plex-Meta-Manager (PMM) must be installed and setup on your machine. Additionally, Trakt MUST be setup in your PMM installation to post 'returning soon' series and various 'extensions' to. This is also what the *-returning-soon.yml and *-in-history.yml files will pull from. The only must-have module is ruamel.yaml. This is included in requirements.txt. Note, some environments may also need 'requests' installed. If you want to use the default template font you will also need the font from the extras folder in your pmm fonts folder.


### Stand-alone setup
    
1. Drop pattrymm.py in a subfolder of your Plex Meta Manager config folder (i.e. Plex-meta-manager/config/pattrmm/pattrmm.py) and run it. A settings file will be created in the newly created preferences folder. The script will stop.
2. Fill in the appropriate settings in preferences/settings.yml (see [Settings file](#settings-file)). You can modify the appearance of the generated overlays file using the preferences/*-returning-soon-template.yml files. 
3. Run the script again after you make your changes to initiate a full cycle.

To update the stand-alone version, you need to delete OR replace vars.py and replace pattrmm.py.


### Docker setup

```yaml
services:
  pattrmm:
    image: ghcr.io/insertdisc/pattrmm:develop
    container_name: pattrmm
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - GUID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - PATTRMM_TIME=02:00  # Schedule run time
    volumes:
      - ./pattrmm/data:/data
      - ./pattrmm/preferences:/preferences
      - ./pmm/config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped  
```

You can initialize the settings file for the docker version with this command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v "./pattrmm/preferences:/preferences" ghcr.io/insertdisc/pattrmm --run
```

The Docker version runs daily at the specified PATTRMM_TIME. This is a 24 hour format.


## Extensions

Extensions have been added and will continue to expand. Extensions Available:

1. In-History
    
   This extension uses the Originally Available At date within Plex to create Trakt lists based on a specified range per library and a corresponding 'in-history' metadata file for use with that library.

2. By-Size
    
    This extension uses information available within Plex to approximate Movie sizes, without needing access to the filesystem, to create an ordered and filtered trakt list and accompanying 'by-size' metadata file for use with each corresponding 'Movie' library.

### Standard library options

```yaml
save_folder: collections/
    # Specify a location to write the returning soon metadata file to. Your PMM config folder
    # (where your config.yml is), will always be the BASE location.
    # So, a save_folder of 'collections/'
    # would put your file in a 'collections' sub-folder. If this directory does not exist
    # PATTRMM will ATTEMPT to create it.
    # Default location is beside your config.yml and does not need specified.

overlay_save_folder: overlays/
    # Specify a location to write the returning soon overlay file to. Your PMM config folder
    # (where your config.yml is), will always be the BASE location.
    # So, a save_folder of 'overlays/'
    # would put your file in a 'overlays' sub-folder. If this directory does not exist
    # PATTRMM will ATTEMPT to create it.
    # Default location is the default PMM 'overlays' folder and does not need specified.

trakt_list_privacy: private
    # Specify public/private trakt list privacy for returning soon list. Can be set per library.
    # Default is private and does not need specified.

refresh: 30
    # Invterval in days to do a full refresh of the libraries airing status.
    # Sometimes things change.
    # This makes sure you stay up to date.

days_ahead: 45
    # How far ahead a title should still be considered 'Returning Soon'.
    # For example, 45, would consider any title that has a 'Returning' status
    # and airs again within the next 45 days to be 'Returning Soon'.

returning-soon: False
    # For those that would like to only run extensions on a 'show' library.
    # This will disable PATTRMM's default 'Returning Soon' operations on this library.
    # The default setting is True and does not need declared.
```


### Standard PATTRMM options

```yaml
date_style: 1
    # This changes how the dates are formatted in the generated overlay files.
    #   1
    #     Will display dates as mm/dd (12/31) for December 31st
    #   2
    #     Will display dates as dd/mm (31/12) for December 31st

date_delimiter: "/"
    # Delimiter for dates. Can be "/", "-", "." or "_", e.g. 01/14, 01-14, 01.14, 01_14
    # Default is '/'

year_in_dates: False
    # Show year in dates: 01/14/22 vs 01/14. True or False
    # Default is False

extra_overlays:
    # Included here are various settings used to customize additional 'airing status' overlays
    # to be included in the generated overlay yml.
    # If they are not wanted they will need to be disabled with
    # use: False
    # as the default behavior is to have them enabled.
```

> **_NOTE:_** These do not need disabled in a 'Movies' only setup. 'Returning Soon' is not compatible with 'Movies' libraries and will skip those libraries.


## Extension settings

Each extension can only be used within a library ONCE, otherwise an error will occur.
In-History supports ONE range per library.


### In-History specific settings

![this_month_in_history](https://github.com/InsertDisc/pattrmm-develop/assets/31751462/71575460-c575-4b12-9e77-77ec6a8a59e5)

```yaml
in-history:  #Enables the 'In History' extension for a library.

    range: month
        # This sets the range you would like to filter for.
        # Options are month, week, day.
        # For example

        #   In 'December', having a 'month' range would filter items throughout the years
        #   that were released in December

        #   During the first week of December, December 1st - December 7th, having a range of 'week'
        #   would filter items released on December 1st - December 7th of qualified years.

        #   On December 5th, having a range of 'day' would filter items releasd on December 5th
        #   of qualified years.

    starting: 1975
        # Allows you to specify the 'earliest' year the filter will go back till.
        # A setting of 1975 would not include anything released prior to 1975.
        # If this declaration is missing then all items up to the 'earliest' will be included.

    ending: 1999
        # Allows you to specify the 'latest' year the filter will go up to.
        # 1999 Would not include anything released after that year.
        # If this delcaration is missing then up to the current year will be included.

    increment: 10
        # Allows you to specify the 'spacing' between valid years.
        # Given an 'ending' year of 2003, would only match to titles released every 10 years out.
        # So, 2003, 1993, 1983, 1973
        # If an 'ending' year is not specified then the current year will be used as the initial year.

    save_folder: collections/

        # would put your file in a 'collections' sub-folder. If this directory does not exist
        # PATTRMM will ATTEMPT to create it.

    trakt_list_privacy: private
        # Specify public/private trakt list privacy for this extension list. Can be set per library.
        # Default is private and does not need specified.

    collection_title: Released this {{range}} in history.
        # Title for the collection in the generated metadata yml file.
        # This can be manually written entirely or you can use {{range}}
        # to fill in the range automatically.
        # Given a range of 'month',
        # Released this {{range}} in history, would generate:
        #     Released this month in history
        # {{Range}} can be used instead for a capitalized range.
        # Released This {{Range}} In History, would generate:
        #     Released This Month In History
        # The {{range}} and {{Range}} placeholders will also work in a 'summary'
        # if you decide to add one to meta options.

    meta:
        # Here's where you can apply your 'touch'.
        # A default generated metadata yml, with no meta options might look something like:

```


## What now

- Add the ?-returning-soon-metadata.yml under the appropriate metadata section of the corresponding library you are having it scan.
- Add the overlays/?-returning-soon-overlay.yml under the appropriate overlay section of the same library.
- Don't forget to add any additional metadata files that any 'extensions' you are using create as well.


## When to run
    
I've tried my best to optimize how PATTRMM runs, meaning, you can run it on a daily basis using whatever scheduling service your OS utilizes. 

After the initial full cycle, only new entries in Plex will get detailed searches. 

Any series that are not considered a returning series will not be updated upon following runs. Any series that loses it's 'Returning Series' status will be updated accordingly and removed from further searches.  This greatly speeds up the process of daily executions.

Docker version runs daily at the specified PATTRMM_TIME value.

When creating a schedule or running manually, make sure to run PATTRMM before running Plex-Meta-Manager to get the latest overlay data into Plex.


### Linux Scheduling Example

When using the standalone version you can create a service and run it using a timer (e.g. on a daily basis).

1. Create a service file for PATTRMM:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pattrmm.service
    ```

    Put the following into the file:

    ```
    # /etc/systemd/system/pattrmm.service

    [Unit]
    Description=PATTRM

    [Service]
    User=USER
    Group=GROUP
    Type=simple
    Environment=LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
    Environment=LANG=C.UTF-8
    WorkingDirectory=/path/to/pattrmm
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /path/to/pattrmm/pattrmm.py
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

    Change USER and GROUP to reflect your user and group.

    Change /path/to/pattrmm to reflect where you’ve copied/installed PATTRMM.

2. Create a timer file for PATTRMM:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pattrmm.timer
    ```

    And put the following into the file:

    ```
    # /etc/systemd/system/pattrmm.timer

    [Unit]
    Description=PATTRM Timer

    [Timer]
    OnCalendar=*-*-* 02:00:00
    Persistent=true
    Unit=pattrmm.service

    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

3. Enable and start the timer/service:
    
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable pattrmm.timer
    sudo systemctl start pattrmm.timer
    ```

    This will run pattrmm.py every day at 2 a.m.
